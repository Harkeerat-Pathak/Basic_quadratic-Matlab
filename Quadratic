The Standard Form of a Quadratic Equation looks like this:

Quadratic Equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0 

a, b and c are known values. a can't be 0.
Solving a quadratic equation require a formula that we are very much familiar with. 
x == −b ± √(b^2 − 4ac) /2a

But when we have to do programming in MATLAB we need to write the above equation in a more simplified waydwith proper notations.

The Standard Form of a Quadratic Equation looks like this:-
x1=(-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
x2=(-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)

Coding in matlab
>>a=3
>>b=2
>>c=-6
>>x1=(-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
x1=1.1196
>>x2=(-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
x2=-1.7863

Thus the correct form of arithmetic operations play the important role. More than that proper use of bracketts
